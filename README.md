# ExploreDAS

 Model building, forward modeling, and imaging of DAS and geophone data.

This MATLAB application was built by Mark E. Willis for the Society of Exploration Geophysicists Distinguished Instructor Short Course in 2022-2023.

This software was developed using the MATLAB 2021a release, but is packaged as an application using MATLAB 2022a.

The software uses the open source SegyMAT-1.5.1 library which is included.

You can install the application directly into your Matlab session using the ExploreDAS.mlappinstall file.

The main function, ExploreDAS, has a switch to include the path to the subdirectories containing the source code (in src, classes, and SegyMAT-1.5.1) that you can modify depending on whether you are running the code or compiling it.
